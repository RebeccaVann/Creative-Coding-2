 Notes for Creative Coding

Circuts

- electricity works in a loop
- resistors limit flow of current amps
- the higher the voltage more motor vroom
- the only way to get more vroom is to have more vâ€™s which requires more batteries which are wired in series
- rgb lights have a certain color based on the voltage sent to the corresponding receptors.
- all electric colors are based on vales of RGB
- +- works vertically ABC works horizontally
-

Code Blocks

- Intro to shapes: Drag and drop with changes to color, perspective and size. flatten perspective to make shapes fit into exact box in 3D space
- add puzzle block to move and rotate on 3d canvas with 0 in the center
